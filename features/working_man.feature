Feature: WorkingMan actually works
In order to make it easy to start and stop work each day
I want to have WorkingMan automatically open and close my apps
So that I can be lazy

  Background:
    Given a mocked home directory

  Scenario: App just runs
    When I get help for "working_man"
    Then the exit status should be 0
    And the output should contain "Commands:"

  Scenario: Prints the version number
    When I run `working_man version`
    Then the output should print the version
    And the exit status should be 0

  Scenario: Prints the version number when using "-v"
    When I run `working_man -v`
    Then the output should print the version
    And the exit status should be 0

  Scenario: Prints the version number when using "--version"
    When I run `working_man --version`
    Then the output should print the version
    And the exit status should be 0

  Scenario: Start work successfully with app and url
